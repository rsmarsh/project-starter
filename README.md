# Project-Starter

## Never again abandon a project before even making it beyond the 'hello world' stage.

## Info

This project uses my preferred configuration, suitable for most React projects. The webpack server is ready to go with a lot of useful tools pre-configured. This project starter was created with minimal feature bloat in mind.

## Stack

The following features & libraries are enabled and ready to go out of the box:

- Webpack
- React
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Babel
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Jest
- NPM Scripts
- VSCode configuration
- SVGR - auto generated React components from SVG files

## Usage

Clone the repo, start with "npm run dev server" in the terminal, and the app will be ready to go
